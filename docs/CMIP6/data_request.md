# CMIP6 Data Request

The CMIP6 data request defines all the quantities from CMIP6 simulations that should be archived. 
This includes both quantities of general interest needed from most of the CMIP6-endorsed model intercomparison projects (MIPs) and quantities that are more specialized and only of interest to a single endorsed MIP. 
The complexity of the data request has increased from the early days of model intercomparisons, as has the data volume. 
In contrast with CMIP5, CMIP6 requires distinct sets of highly tailored variables to be saved from each of the more than 300 experiments. 
This places new demands on the data request information base and leads to a new requirement for development of software that facilitates automated interrogation of the request and retrieval of its technical specifications.
